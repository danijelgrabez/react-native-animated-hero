Demo ðŸ‘‰[Expo Snack](https://snack.expo.io/@danijelgrabez/animated-hero).

- Wrapping component which is consisted of navigation, hero and content sections.
- Component has detection for safe area if the application is reviewed from "notch", or "frameless" screens (e.g. iPhoneX)
- Hero component animation happens on scroll:
  - image opacity goes from opaque to transparent (vice versa for gradient opacity)
  - hero section transforms to navigation bar.
  - navigation is position fixed so that user can always reach contextual actions
